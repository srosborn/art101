	<h2>What Is This Lab About?</h2>
	<p>This lab is all about making file structures, connecting files to others, and uploading them to servers.</p>
	<h2>What Was Difficult?</h2>
	<p>Making the HTML file for the homepage wasn't any trouble, and neither has decorating it despite the fact I'm usually pretty unimaginative when it comes to decorating.</p>
	<h2>What Are the Results?</h2>
	<p>The results are what you're seeing right now. This is the page I made for the lab, and below is a screenshot of my file structure, as well as the other screenshots taken for this lab.</p>
