//How to Start a Manual Car
  //1. Use key to unlock the car door
  //2. Get inside the car
  //3. Put key into the ignition
    //Make sure one foot is engaging the break, and that one foot is engaging the clutch
  //4. If key is in ignition;
    //Turn right
  //5. Set car gear into 1st
  //6. While pressing down on gas:
    //Slowly come off clutch
    //This may take practice so be patient!
  //7. If the car is moving and your foot is fully off the clutch:
    //Disengage the gas
    //Engage clutch again
  //8. While step 4 is repeating:
    //Set gear to 2nd

//Pseudocoding the card game War (with gambling)
  //1. Randomly select a card for the player and for the computer before each round.
  //2. Accept user input of amount they would like to bet, or deciding to fold.
    //If player chooses fold, reset the board
  //3. Computer calls after a certain card threshold.
    //More advanced systems can chose to call based on card value and amount the player has bet
  //4. Test of win or lose condition.
  //5. Repeat from step 1.
